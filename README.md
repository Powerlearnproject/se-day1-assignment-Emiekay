# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Sotfware engineering is the branch of computer science that deals with design,development,testing and maintnance of software application.it shapes our digital world,drives technological advancements, and enables business to thrive.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Design model,cloud computing,deployment

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning,requirements,design and prototype,software development,testing,deployment and maintenance.depending on different variables

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is senquential and rigid, with distinct phases completed in order, it focuses on thorough planning and execution in pretedermined.
Agile is flexible and iterative.emphasizing continuous feedback and adaption,promoting ongoing collaboration

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer create and maintain software,testing an debugging,conducting development tests
quality assurance engineer plan test,create test to identify software problems,analyze testing
project manager monitor progress, set project goals, budget forecasting, documentation

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Intergrated development enviroments enhance productivity and efficiency
veesion control system streamline development processes, enabling faster iteration and delivery of features.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Lack of work flow,prepare your team to be highly resiliend and respond to all sorts of challenges
broken sdlc process, use an engineering management workflow platform to analyze high PR review and PR ratio, and identify optimal review workload for your team.
Lack of predictable in software delivery,minimize external dependability, especially, avoid getting locked in the cloud

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing is to ensure that each unit of the software performs as intended and meets requirements,it helps to make sure that software is working as expected before it is released'
Intergration is a type of functional testing that verifies how different componenetsor modukes of a software system work together, it can help detect errors, improvr quality and ensures compatibility of your software.
System helps to identify both functionla dn non-functional issues and can uncover defects as well asprevent them, it verifies a systems code and functionality against its requirements
Acceptance confirms the software's stability and checks for flaws

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Is the process of structuring and instruction that can be interpreted and understood by a generated AI model.it guides AI models in generating accurate and relevent output.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
i want to build a better app
I want to develop a mobile app for tracking personal expenses, with fitures to categorize psending, set budges and generate monthly report.the app should be use friendly, secure and compatible with both ios and andriod devices
The improved prompt is more effective for several reasons: specificity, scope defination, requirements clarity, reduced ambiguity,enhance callaboration helps in prioritizing
